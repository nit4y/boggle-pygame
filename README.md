# Boggle in Pygame
This is a boggle game written entirely in Python (pygame)

## Music
We don't own the music here. It is CD Projekt RED property (thats actually some The Witcher 3 music added for fun).

Notable features:
1. Square marking for next possible move -
with each move the user makes the game will mark the next possible movments on the board

2. Music - music was added to make the game more exiting and fun
the main menu screen has calming music, while the game screen has more intense music

3. Timer changes color to red when under 30 seconds

4. Added "Rules and About" screen - containing the basic rules for Boggle, and a short explanation about the project.
